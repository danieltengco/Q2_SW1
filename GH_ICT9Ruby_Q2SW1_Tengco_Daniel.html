			<td>Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike. Canines of this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques.<br>Their noses guide them through life, and they’re never happier than when following an interesting scent. Beagles originally were bred as scenthounds to track small game, mostly rabbits and hare. They’re still used for this purpose in many countries today, including the United States. But you’ll find plenty of these pups living as companion dogs and loving, furry family members.</td>

			<td>Doberman Pinschers originated in Germany during the late 19th century, mostly bred as guard dogs. Their exact ancestry is unknown, but they’re believed to be a mixture of many dog breeds, including the Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier, and German Pinscher. <br>With their sleek coat, athletic build, and regal appearance, this pup looks like an aristocrat. They’re highly energetic and smart dogs who perform well in police and military work, canine sports, and as family guardians and companions.</td>
